This is my solution to the [QR code component coding challenge ](https://) on Frontend Mentor.

### The Challenge

The goal was to build a simple, responsive QR code component that matches the provided design. The challenge is focused on fundamental front-end skills, specifically HTML and CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - For structuring the content, including the card, image, and text.
- **CSS3** - For all styling, including layout, typography, and responsive design.
- **Flexbox** - Used for centering the card on the page.

## My Process 🛠️
### 1. HTML Structure 📋
I created a semantic HTML structure with:

- A single `<main>` container to hold the entire card component.
- Inside the main container, I used a `<div>` element for the card itself.
- Within the card div, I placed the `<img>` tag for the QR code and a separate `<div>` for the text content.
- The text content div contains an `<h1>` for the heading and a `<p>` for the descriptive text.

### 2. Styling 🎨
- **Mobile-first approach** 📱
- **Typography** Imported and applied custom fonts
- **Layout**  I used Flexbox on the <body> element to perfectly center the card both horizontally and vertically on the page.
- **Card Styling** I applied a background color, border-radius, and box-shadow to the main card container to match the design.
- **Spacing** Used padding within the card div to create the correct spacing around the image and text.

## 📚 What I Learned
- **Centering with Flexbox:** This project was a great refresher on using Flexbox to easily center an element on the screen without complex positioning.

- **Basic Box Model:** I reinforced my understanding of the CSS box model, specifically how padding, margin, and border-radius work together to style components.

- **Project Workflow:** It was good practice to follow a clean workflow: setting up the HTML structure first, then moving on to basic styling, and finally refining the details to match the design.
